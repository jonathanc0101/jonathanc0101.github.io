            <h2>The first emperor</h2>
            <p>He may be wrongly considered the first emperor of Rome, but he certainly did occupy a place similar to that of an emperor, near the end of his ruling he</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Dressed in purple (like the kings of Rome did).</li>

                <li>Ordered to put his statue near the ones of the seven kings of Rome suggesting that he was also one of them.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    Made the senate name him dictator for life, accounting for the fact that dictatorship was a position of power in the (at the time) Roman republic, that normally lasted 6 months.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Importance of the facts in the context</h3>
            
            <p> You might say "why does all this matter? I get it, dictator sounds bad". But there is more to this than that. Dictatorship was a position of power granted to someone to be "in charge" for a period of six months originally, albeit turbulent times had to endanger the republic for this title to be given; To imagine someone to be able to pass laws without consulting the senate, to have power over a big portion of the army, it's unthinkable nowadays. Imagine that the president wanted to make everyone stay home for ten consecutive months consecuently stopping the economy. (Ups, that happened in Argentina in 2021)</p>

            <h2>The atrocities</h2>
            <p>
                Well. He wanted power, he got it, he had an ego the size of Jupiter(the planet, not the god). Did the people liked him? Yes they did, they loved him, so much so that they turned him into a god after his death. Did he do good? Yes, he did, turning a decaying republic on it's head is good. But he also did bad, he also did horribly bad sometimes, this are some of the atrocities he did:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Illegaly marched into neighboring Roman territory,</strong> decimating all the Gaellic tribes who opposed him, showing no mercy. In one of the last battles against the tribes in <strong>51BC</strong>, after winning a decisive battle, "he decided against executing or selling the survivors into slavery, as had been customary in contemporary battles. Instead, he had the hands of all the surviving men of military age cut off, but left them alive. He then dispersed the vanquished Gauls throughout the province for all to see that they would never again be able to take up arms against him or the Roman Republic." to quote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Uxellodunum" target="_blank"></a>Wikipedia</li>

                <li><strong>Massacred and erased from existance two germanic tribes</strong> "In Julius Caesarâ€™s personal account of the Gallic Wars, De Bello Gallico, the Roman commander detailed the massacre of two Germanic tribes by Roman troops in <strong>55 BC</strong>. The tribes had asked Caesar for asylum. Instead, they were massacred. Caesar boasted that his troops killed 430,000 people, the majority of them women and children. Some died by sword or spear either in battle or while fleeing the Romans. Others attempting escape drowned in a nearby river."-quoted from <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/72783/dutch-archaeologists-find-site-massacre-julius-caesar-boasted-about">mentalfloss</a></li>

                It is what it is, a recollection of some facts, a view of the grim reality humanity created, a look into moral and ethic shades of grey that history leaves us. But it also is a reminder that times change. We are currently living in the most peaceful times that human history had to offer, maybe because if we had a third world war, there wouldn't be a fourth one.
